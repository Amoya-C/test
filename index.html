		    <h3>Quote</h3>
		    <p><em>"If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life"</em> <br>~ Marcus Garvey</p>
		    <br>
		    <p>My interpretation of this quote is that if you have no self-confidence, then you are setting yourself back, 
		    preventing yourself from reaching your own goal. Not only are you defeated by yourself, but also by not doing 
		    what you set out to do. This quote was taken from Marcus Garvey, Jamaica's first National Hero. He was a source
		    of inpiration to many people, including me. He advocated for the rights of black persons, race pride and self reliance.
		    Today, his influence still impacts the people of Jamaica.</p>
